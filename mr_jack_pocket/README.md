# Mr Jack Pocket

This is for the 2011 printing with a box base measuring 84.5mm x 84.5mm.  There are two versions of the print, one with `no_bottom` that doesn't have a bottom layer and makes the booklet fit better and one that is "normal" that has a small bottom layer.  Personally, I prefer the bottom layer and the box not shutting 100% closed.
